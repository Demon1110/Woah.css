# Woah.css
CSS Animation Library for eccentric web developers. 

## How to use
Download woah.css and put it in your documents ```head```.

```
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="animate.min.css">
</head>
```

## Adding Animations
To animate an element, simply add the class ```woah``` followed by whichever animation you choose. Example:

```
<h1 class="woah wowzors"Hello world</h1>
```

# Different types of animations
Woah.css has three different types of animations to choose from.

## Woah animations
These are very eccentric and barely practical, but are very fun and showy.

## Wow animations
These are still a little eccentric, but could very well be used in normal websites. 

## Normie animations
These are very basic.

## To Do List
 - Add CSS Variables to easily change duration with inline styles
 - Add class that repeats animations forever
